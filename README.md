# FastAPI Learning 

This repository contains all my practice codes while learning **FastAPI**.  
I have explored the basics of building APIs, including CRUD operations, and also deployed my project online using **Render**.

--- 

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to FastAPI
- Creating API endpoints
- HTTP Methods:
  - GET – Retrieve data
  - POST – Create data
  - PUT – Update data
  - DELETE – Delete data
- Using Pydantic models for data validation
- Testing APIs with Swagger UI
- Deploying FastAPI apps to Render

--- 

## Deployment
You can test my deployed FastAPI project using **Swagger UI** here:  
[**Click Here to Open Swagger UI**](https://fastapi-demo-7fju.onrender.com/docs)
